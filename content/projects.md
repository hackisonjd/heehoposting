## Working on

- [Heehoposting](https://heehoposting.xyz), the site that you're on right now!
  - I like to call this version the 2.0 update of Heehoposting, since I have more of a vision of what I want the website to be.
- Discord bots!
  - My most recent project is a Discord bot called [LekBot](https://github.com/jacksondarman/lekbot), which takes in [Civilization data from a Google Doc](https://github.com/jacksondarman/lekscrape) and prints it out to a Discord server.
  - I'm also working on a personal bot that sends memes and funny images from time to time in my Discord server.
- My homelab!
  - Big shocker, I'm a massive fan of the self-hosting movement. The more excuses I have to put servers in my closet the happier I am.
- Tyrant's Grave
  - Tyrant's Grave is a fighting game regional tournament in Virginia. You can read more about it <small>(and sign-up)</small> [here](https://start.gg/tyrant-s-grave).

In general, I like to work on projects that solve problems that mildly irritate me, so this list of projects will undoubtedly grow larger as more things grind my gears. ðŸ˜‰

## Learning about

- Practical study of algorithms and their use in problem solving.
  - Divide-and-conquer
  - Greedy algorithms
  - Backtracking
  - Network flow
  - Dynamic programming
- Parallel and distributed computing
  - Shared memory
  - Clustering (using Slurm)
  - Peer-to-peer protocols
  - Cloud computing models
  - Distributed file systems
  - Perfomance benchmarking and analysis

I've also been diving into learning effective server administration, hoping to eventually to get my CompTIA Security+ when I'm not too busy. ^^
