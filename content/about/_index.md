Hello! I am a 24-year-old with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
James Madison University. My main areas of interest are cybersecurity,
systems administration, and all things Linux. Outside of the realm of
computing, I love tabletop games, my slightly overweight cat, and a nice
cold glass of Dr Pepper.

## Getting In Touch

My preferred way of communicating is through e-mail. If you need to get in
contact with me, sending me a quick email is typically the best way to do it.

All of my emails are signed with my

encrypt your mail if you're so inclined.

## What I Use

I have a plethora of computers lying around performing various duties in my
home office, but these are the ones that see the most use.

### Desktop

#### The Darmanator

The Darmanator is my daily-driver system that is designed to handle any game
that I can throw at it while looking pretty awesome. Here's the parts list:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950x
* Motherboard: MSI X570S Carbon MAX WiFi
* RAM: 64GB Corsair Vengeance RGB @ 3200 MHz
* GPU: PowerColor Red Devil RX 6900XT
* PSU: 1000W EVGA Gold

I dual boot this system, as I do most of my gaming and programming work on
Arch Linux (yes, I am one of those people). However, some of the games my
friends play use invasive anti-cheat software, so I am forced to also keep
Windows 11 installed.

Just as an aside to anti-cheat developers who refuse to acknowledge that
Linux gaming is a growing market:

### Laptops

#### M4 MacBook Pro

During his last lecture of the semester, one of my professors in my senior
year encouraged the class to use computers and systems that felt foreign to
us. His logic was that, in order to be the best developer you can be, you
must experience a wide breadth of tools.

Eventually, I picked up a base model M4 MacBook Pro on sale with the goal of
learning macOS and iOS development and seeing what all the hype was about.
It quickly took over as my primary workhorse when I am out of the house.

High school me would probably be extremely disappointed in me, but this
laptop is powerful, silent, efficient, and works extremely well with the
Apple ecosystem that has made its way into my life over the years.

#### Framework 16

This was my primary laptop during the later half of my time in college, and
one of the very few devices I have ever pre-ordered.

Framework's laptops embody something I wish was more common: the ability to
easily repair and upgrade your own hardware. While the irony of switching to
a MacBook later is not lost on me, I still firmly believe in the importance
of right-to-repair.

These days, it has shifted into a portable gaming machine for conventions and
events. I also use it as a home-theater PC when I want to play demanding
games on my TV instead of at my desk. In the long term, it may become a
server in my homelab.

#### The ThinkPad Armada

I have owned many ThinkPads throughout my life, especially during high school
and early college. They are an incredible value on the secondhand market, and
I highly recommend them to anyone on a budget.

These days, they form the "Hivemind" nodes in my homelab that I primarily use
to experiment with Kubernetes on real hardware. Here is a list of the most
notable ones:

* X230 – bought in high school (Node 3 in the Hivemind)
* T440p – bought in my first semester of community college (RIP motherboard)
* T430 – bought in my last semester of community college (Node 2)
* X301 – used mainly for learning Coreboot
* T480 – bought in my first semester at JMU (Node 1)
