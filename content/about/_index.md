title: Meet the Author
---
Hello! I am a 24-year-old with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from James
Madison University. My main areas of interest are cybersecurity, systems
administration, and all things Linux. Outside of the realm of computing, I love
tabletop games, my slightly overweight cat, and a nice cold glass of Dr Pepper.

## Getting In Touch

My preferred way of communicating is through e-mail. If you need to get in contact
with me, sending me a quick email is typically the best way to do it.

All of my emails are signed with my

your mail as well if you're so inclined.

* Fingerprint: ```2391 9C52 22BD 6606 09B8 19D7 DCAA 4BFD D1A9 132D```

## What I Use

I have a plethora of computers lying around performing various duties in my home
office, but these are the ones that see the most use.

## Desktop

### THE DARMANATOR

The Darmanator is my daily-driver system that is designed to handle any game that
I can throw at it and look pretty awesome while doing it. Here's the parts list:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950x
* Motherboard: MSI X570S Carbon MAX WiFi
* RAM: 64GB of Corsair Vengeance RGB @ 3200 MHz
* GPU: PowerColor Red Devil RX 6900XT
* PSU: 1000W EVGA Gold

I am forced to dual boot this system, as I do most of my gaming + actual
programming work on my Arch Linux install (yes, I'm one of those people), but my
friends want me to play games with them. Those games have invasive anticheat. So
I'm forced to use Windows 11.

Just as an aside, dear anticheat developers who refuse to understand that Linux
gaming is a growing market and will continue to grow as Windows gradually gets
worse with each new update:

## Laptops

### M4 MacBook Pro

During his last lecture of the semester, one of my professors in my senior year
of college encouraged the class to use computers and systems that seemed foreign
to us before outright dismissing them. His logic was that in order to be the best
developer you can be, you need to experience a wide breadth of the tools
available to you.

I eventually came around to that idea, and I ended up picking up a base model M4
MacBook Pro on sale with the goal of learning the ins and outs of developing
software for MacOS and iOS, and to see what the hype was about. The MacBook
ended up taking the mantle as my primary workhorse when I'm out of the house.
High school me would probably be so disappointed in me for being a sellout,
but whatever. This laptop is pretty powerful, runs quietly, sips on power, and
it works well with all of the Apple stuff that has found its way into my room
over the years. I couldn't ask for anything more (except for Apple trusting me
enough to fix it myself).

### Framework 16

This was my primary laptop during my last couple of years in college, and one of
the only things that I have ever pre-ordered (I was the most annoying person
imaginable while I was waiting for this to get to my house).

All of Framework's laptops embody something that I wish was more prevalent these
days: being able to repair your own stuff. Yes, the irony of getting a MacBook
two years after I got this is not lost on me, but I genuinely think the world
is a better place to live in when manufacturers let you repair your own stuff.

Nowadays, this laptop is my portable gaming setup for when I'm going to
conventions and events, which I tend to do at least once or twice a year. I also
use it as my home-theater PC for when I want to play demanding games in front of
my TV rather than my cluttered office desk. In the long-term, I'll probably end
up turning it into a server in my homelab, but I don't see myself doing that any
time soon.

### The ThinkPad Armada

I've owned many ThinkPads throughout my life, especially during my later high
school to early college years. ThinkPads are just a really good value if you buy
them secondhand, and if you're on a tight budget I really can't recommend
anything else. Nowadays, all of them are the "Hivemind" nodes in my homelab that
are used to learn Kubernetes on actual hardware. Here's the complete list of
ThinkPads I have loved (and lost) over the years.

* X230, bought in high school (Node 3 in the Hivemind)
* T440p, bought in my first semester of community college (died to a motherboard
electrical failure, RIP)
* T430, bought during my last semester of community college (Node 2 in the Hivemind)
* X301, really only bought it to learn how to use Coreboot, its too old and slow
for anything else
* T480, bought during my first semester at JMU (Node 1 in the Hivemind)
