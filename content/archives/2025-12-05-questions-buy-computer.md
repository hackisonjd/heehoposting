Many of my friends have been considering building or upgrading a computer
recently, and the question that I receive the most tends to something like this:

"Is [Insert generic computer part/computer here] worth buying?"

Like most engineering scenarios, it depends! Depends on what, exactly? Well, that's
what this article is for.

Below are four questions that you should ask yourself before buying computer parts.

## Part 1: What is your budget?

This is the first question I ask my friends when they ask for recommendations and
this is the first question I'll ask you, as well.

Unless you have a lot of disposable income (which is not many people), you need
to figure out how much you're willing to spend on a computer. This magical
number will guide you throughout the entire buying process.

It's important to not deviate from this number. Stick to your budget. This
applies not only to building computers, but literally every other
aspect of your life unless you have a specific, non-negotiable reason. "I just
want a computer" is not a good enough reason.

## Part 2: What do you need this computer for?

Computers are tools. Like most other tools, you buy them to fix a specific problem.
What problem are you hoping to solve?

Most people I talk to want to play games on their computer, but that's not the only
reason you'd want to buy a computer. Sometimes, you may want to do some video editing.
Maybe you want to work on a video game?
[Maybe you even want to compile the whole Linux kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfv0V1SxbNA&t=401s).

## Part 3: Do you need to be mobile?

If you need to work on the go semi-regularly, you're basically locked into a
laptop or a SFF (small-form-factor) build. You *can* build or buy a regular
computer tower if you're mobile, but speaking from personal experience, it's not
something I'd recommend.

## Part 4: Are you okay with buying used hardware?

Used hardware can be way cheaper. If you're on a tight budget and have a high
risk tolerance to used electronics (especially if you can fix them yourself),
then it may be the only way that makes sense for you. In general, if you can't
find the performance you're looking for at your price point from new hardware,
used hardware is the way to go.
