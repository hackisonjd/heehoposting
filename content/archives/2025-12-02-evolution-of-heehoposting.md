Well... we've come a long way, haven't we?

This month marks the fourth year anniversary of Heehoposting! I'm honestly pretty shocked at how far this website has come over the years, and I wanted to take a little bit to explain the process and decisions that I've made over the years. These are things that I'm sure younger me would have appreciated, so I'm hoping that it inspires any of you to start going down this rabbit hole. It's a lot of fun, and I've learned so much along the way.

## Chapter 1: A Calling
I'm going to be completely honest here, social media has always annoyed me. It always has. I hated the fact that the only way to get a clear picture of who I was as a person was through the random Instagram photo I posted every other year, and I've always disliked having to filter myself in order to not scare anyone away, and I never liked that no matter what I posted, it felt fake. Wrong. Like I wasn't telling the whole truth.

This feeling of malaise culminated in intensity around December 2021. I was going through many upending life changes around this time. My previous long-term relationship was starting to show cracks, I was about to start my first semester of college at James Madison University, and I managed to catch COVID for the second time. I needed some kind of outlet, an escape.

And then I saw one YouTube video about how to build your own website.

I don't remember who the creator was. I don't even remember the title of the video. It was some guy who was going on and on about how easy it was to set up, walking through the entire process on his crusty old ThinkPad X220 that was constantly thermal throttling. Apparently, recording a video and hosting a local server at the same time was too much for the dual core i5 from a decade ago to take. That video was my invitation to dive deeper. "I can definitely do this", I thought to myself.

So, over the holiday break, I did all of the research that I could to make this website a reality. I bought a domain name for the very first time (a reference to my favorite video game franchise of all time), agonized for hours to try to get the DNS records to match up correctly to my DigitalOcean VPS, and banged my head against the wall on raw HTML/CSS for the better part of a week. It was one of the most fun things I had ever worked on at that point outside of school. I was using my passion for creativity and my budding technical knowledge together, and it felt like I had truly found a project I wanted to take care of.

Looking back at the WayBack Machine archive today is an... interesting experience. It was pretty obvious that I didn't know what I was doing. The background was this ugly, green and black gradient with just a basic Times New Roman font. It was honestly something very reminiscent of what you would see in the late 90s on Web 1.0. But at the time, I was proud of what I had created. It felt like the first thing that I had created on the Internet that was truly mine.

[Here's the link to the Wayback Machine archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220118175437/http://www.heehoposting.xyz/). I'm warning you though, it will burn your retinas. To be honest, I look back at it four years later and cringe a little bit, but I guess that's owed to the fact that my life has significantly changed since I've built it. This was a very important first step for me, but nowhere close to the end of the story.

### Chapter 1.5: Heehoposting Redux

Around three months after I had started classes at James Madison University, I was beginning to get into the flow of my daily life. Everything felt better and more natural. I was actually leaving my apartment and going to events, and meeting several new friends along the way.

However, this came with a consequence. As my personal life got busier and busier, I started focusing my time on Heehoposting less and less. I had a plethora of ideas for it, but I could never seem to muster up enough will to act of them. I was talking with my friends about how I wanted an actual blog for Heehoposting ever since I had built it, but I only got around to it last year. Life was just extremely hectic for me at the time. However, that didn't stop me from doing some minor aesthetic changes.

I updated the font from Times New Roman to Cantarell. There wasn't really any rhyme or reason for it. I daily drove Fedora Linux at the time and I liked the font well enough, so up onto the site it went. I also changed the look of the site from a retro terminal-esque look to a more standard, kind of boring dark-gray background.

I was also beginning to learn about cryptography around this time, and I had taken an interest in it. So much so, that I learned how GPG worked and uploaded my public key so that people could send me encrypted mail. I think to this day, only one person actually did it, but it was the coolest thing ever.
